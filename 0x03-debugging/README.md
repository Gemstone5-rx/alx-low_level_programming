# This project involves tasks on debugging in C programming language;

* These tasks include;
- [x] create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
- [x] Copy a main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- [x] Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- [x] Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
