# This project consists of tasks such as;

* write a function that;
- [x] checks for uppercase character
- [x] checks for a digit (0 through 9)
- [x] multiplies two integers
- [x] prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
- [x] prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
- [x] prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
- [x] draws a straight line in the terminal
- [x] draws a diagonal line on the terminal
- [x] prints a square, followed by a new line
- [x] prints a triangle, followed by a new line
- [x] prints an integer

* write a program that;
- [x] prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
- [x] finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line
