# This Project consists of;

* Writing a program that;
- [x] prints \_putchar, followed by a new line
- [x] computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line
- [x] prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line
- [x] finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line
- [x] finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line

* Witing a function that;
- [x] prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- [x] prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- [x] checks for lowercase character
- [x] checks for alphabetic character
- [x] prints the sign of a number
